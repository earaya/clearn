## Why?

Because everyone should know C. Trust me, it'll be good for you; a lot of stuff you currently do will make sense. You'll gain insights and appreciation for your preferred language and for C. You'll understand how a computer works much, much better.

## What?

Samples and excercises from "The C Programming Language". I've annotated the code (with comments) to explain and expound on some of the more interesting points of C.

## How?

Each file consists of a small C program. All you have to do is:

```shell
$ gcc -ansi sample.c
$ ./a.out
```
